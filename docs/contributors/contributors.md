Hello :wave:  I am Tegveer Ghura and I recently completed an enthralling and rewarding summer internship with Ploomber as a Data Scientist. I am currently a graduate student in the MS in Data Science & Analytics program at Georgetown University and am working towards establishing myself in the industry after graduating in May 2024. I also hold a Bachelor’s degree in Economics from Boston University and have a year’s worth of experience in Finance.

The internship with Ploomber has kickstarted my career in Tech and honed my Data Engineering skills to a whole new extent. Moreover, I wrote production-quality code using the JupySQL package while documenting its functionality, which provided me a deep, intuitive level of understanding the dynamics of the JupySQL package with everyday Data Science practices. I also enjoyed teamwork at Ploomber while building the SQL course and learned a host of new skills, including ETL pipelining and code containerization, from my peers. I highly recommend applying to Ploomber to those looking to gain an enriching internship experience as well as using its packages to streamline project workflows!
