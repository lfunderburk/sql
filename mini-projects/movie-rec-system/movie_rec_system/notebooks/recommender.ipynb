    "# Recommendation Systems\n",
    "\n",
    "Recommendation systems seek to predict and present users with items or content they would find relevant and engaging. They operate behind the scenes in many of the digital platforms we interact with daily, such as streaming services, online retail sites, and social media platforms. At their core, these systems analyze vast amounts of data, including user behavior, preferences, and other contextual information to curate personalized content or product suggestions. The importance of recommendation systems lies in their ability to enhance user experience and engagement, drive content or product discovery, and boost business metrics like sales and retention. By offering tailor-made suggestions, they ultimately mitigate information overload, facilitate more informed choices, and play a pivotal role in enhancing user satisfaction and loyalty.\n",

    "Content-based recommenders work by analyzing the attributes of items as well as a user's historical interactions with such items. In this case, our items are movies and their attributes of interest are their respective `genre_names` and `overview` columns. Given that our data excludes any information on users, we will primarily focus on just comparing each movie's attributes to find similar ones.\n",
