    "From the bar plot of fuel-only cars, we can see that the <b>number of unique car brand models</b> introduced to the Canadian automobile market had been increasing from the turn of the 21st century to the year 2005. This increasing trend then plateued and remained fairly constant until 2022, with 2015 experiencing the largest spike. On December 21, 2022, Steven Guilbeault, Canada's minister of environment and climate change, unveiled a regulation that would require increasing percentages of vehicle sales in Canada to be zero-emissions vehicles up to 100% by the year 2035[$^1$](https://www.canada.ca/en/environment-climate-change/news/2022/12/let-it-roll-government-of-canada-moves-to-increase-the-supply-of-electric-vehicles-for-canadians.html). These efforts seem to have had an immediate impact on the number of fuel-only cars introduced to the Canadian market, with 2023 experiencing a sharp decline and reaching 2003 levels. \n",

    "The above insights are reinforced by the bar plot of the number of unique hybrid and electric car brands and their respective models introduced to the Canadian automobile market. In 2012, only two electric car models, Nissan's Leaf and Mitsubishi's i-MiEV, and one hybrid car manufacturer, Chevrolet's Volt, were present in the market. Since then, this figure has grown to 134 electric car models and 32 hybrid car models in 2023 in Canada."

    "The above scatterplot helps us compare the ranges and charging times of electric cars by their size or model year. Although one could deduce that higher recharge times (depending on the car's battery size, quality, etc.) would lead to travelling greater ranges, the graph offers more details that are worth exploring. For example, electric cars manufactured recently (2022 and onwards) have a much higher range, on average, than those manufactured between 2012 and 2021. This is likely due to the advancements in battery technology and the increased demand for electric cars. Moreover, some electric cars recently manufactured provide a better range with 10 hours of recharge time than those manufactured previously with 12 hours of recharge time. Furthermore, some new electric cars with recharge times of 10 hours provide as good a range as both new and older electric cars with recharge times greater than 10 hours (13 hours being the outlier). Maybe 10 hours is the sweet spot for recharge time?\n",
    "\n",
    "If we shift our focus to vehicle size, there are more electric sedans (and smaller) than there are SUV's (and larger) for lower recharge times between 4 to 7 hours and this is expected due to the difference in car sizes. Sedans, on average, also seem to provide greater ranges than SUV's for recharge times greater than 7 hours. However, for recharge times less than 7 hours, SUV's provide greater ranges than sedans. This could be due to the fact that SUV's have larger batteries and, therefore, can travel greater ranges with less recharge time. Moreover, some sedans with 10 hours of recharge time provide better ranges than all SUV's do with greater than 10 hours of recharge time!\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, consumers have a wide range of options to choose from when it comes to electric cars! Choosing wisely by assessing the tradeoff between recharge time and range is key and this graph helps us do just that."

If we select the `fill` attribute to `vehicle_type`, we obtain a clear view that fuel-only cars emit the most $CO_2$. In fact, they can pollute up to 6x more than hybrid cars! Hybrid cars have both an electric motor and a gasoline engine, which allows them to emit less $CO_2$ than fuel-only cars. The range of $CO_2$ emitted from hybrid vehicles ranges between 10 to 80 grams per kilometer, while the distribution of $CO_2$ emissions for fuel-only cars ranges from 100 to 500 grams per kilometer, with the bulk of vehicles emitting between 200 to 300 grams per kilometer.

However, since most cars run on regular gasoline, the area occupied for it in the histogram is greater. Diesel and Ethanol (E85) are slightly cleaner than gasoline as their emissions range from 150 to 400 grams per kilometer with the bulk of vehicles emitting between 200 to 300 grams per kilometer (similar to both gasoline types).

    "The boxplots above show the distribution of $CO_2$ emissions for hybrid and fuel-only US manufactured cars. Viewing the boxplot at its highest level i.e without a `hue`, suggests that Chrysler has the lowest median $CO_2$ emission, at around 250 grams per kilometer, out of all car brands. Chevrolet, on the other hand, has the highest median $CO_2$ emission, at around 300 grams per kilometer, out of all car brands. Chrysler also has also the lowest interquartile range, which could imply that the $CO_2$ emissions of its cars are more consistent than those of other car brands. \n",
    "\n",
    "However, upon selecting `hue` as `vehicle_type`, we see that Chevrolet's hybrid cars have the lowest median $CO_2$ emission out of all hybrid car brands. Yet, its fuel-only cars pollute the most on average. Jeep's hybrid cars pollute the most, on average, out of all US hybrid car brands, while its fuel-only cars' median $CO_2$ emissions are at par with that of Chrysler's, the cleanest fuel-only US brand.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lastly, the boxplot of $CO_2$ emissions for hybrid and fuel-only US manufactured cars by transmission type portrays that continuously variable transmission cars pollute the least out of the other available transmissions. These cars would likely correspond to the hybrid cars of the US brands, which are the cleanest out of all hybrid cars. Another interesting observation is that all brands, apart from Chrysler, have lower median $CO_2$ emissions for manual transmission cars than for automatic transmission cars. In fact, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) found that vehicles with a manual transmission were more efficient than their automatic counterparts through about 2010, but modern automatic transmissions are now more efficient [$^3$](https://www.epa.gov/sites/default/files/2021-01/documents/420r21003.pdf). Only Ford has an automated manual transmission available for its cars, which has a significantly wide distribution for $CO_2$ emissions, similar to Cadillac's continuously variable transmissions cars, but a median $CO_2$ emission that is lower than that of its automatic transmission cars."
